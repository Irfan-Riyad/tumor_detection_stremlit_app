For my AI course (CSE366), I developed a Streamlit app for brain tumor detection. The app supports three models: ResNet50, DenseNet, and EfficientNet.

It allows users to load a .pth file, which contains the trained model’s knowledge (saved after training). Users can also set class names and adjust the number of classes as needed.

Additionally, the app provides two visualization options — Grad-CAM and LIME — to help interpret the model’s predictions.
